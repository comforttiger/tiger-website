6) make a post composer! lets me write the whole post on the dang website.
    - also add some way to edit posts maybe? would be nice to be able to make a draft, post it, and update it, all without needing to go on the vscodes and open the dev server and stuff.
    - add a page with unanswered asks, and a button to answer them! would probably just be the exact same post composer, but now it has the ask field filled in
    - maybe look up how to make search engines not crawl these pages
