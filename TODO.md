# STUFF I WANNA DO!!

1) port things that used to be in `likes` over to my blog
    - antonymph
        - write about how much i love this song. also write about how i found the song thru the antonymph pop-up music video, and how impressive that website is too (antonymph, vylet pony, and a pop-up music video)
    - goodbye to halos
        - write some words abt how great goodbye to halos is
    - girlfriend post
        - port over the girlfriend post. i think im gonna set its date to be like, when i first actually wrote it
    - compilation of bookmarked videos
        - it doesnt make sense to have one entry for each video, but i'm totally cool w having one post that links to lots of bookmarked videos
    - compilation of favourite artists
        - ditto
    - maybe another compilation of all bookmarks, but im not so sure
    - tiara pics remain separate from the rest of the website. dunno if i'll keep it as pets pics or make it officially be tiara pics only
        - maybe i can add it to the main page, but exclude it from being added to the feed. cuz i dont want every kitty picture to be addded to the rss feed...
2) add descriptions to tags
3) other cool sites to add
    - [platinumtulip](https://platinumtulip.garden/)
    - [colrana](https://colrana.neocities.org/)
4) replace all the fonts and images ive been downloading with woff and webp
