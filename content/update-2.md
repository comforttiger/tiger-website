whats uppp. i realllyyy wanna update this blog more often!! blogging is sooo hard its so hard to be me

last time i did like an update post was like 2 months ago. stuff's happened since then probably! who knows what... in this blog post, you and i will endeavour to remember my past. together. you're helping.

## reading
i've started reading recently!!! i figured if i could get into watching movies after a long time of not being able to, then maybe i can get into reading also cuz thats a thing ive always wanted to do more!! "ok but what have you read" you ask? ummm

#### nevada
i read nevada! throughout most of my reading it i kinda thought i was gonna finish it thinking it was an ok book. but like the ending made me appreciate the book so much more and what it was going for. honestly a great book.

#### house of leaves
ive been reading house of leaves!! im at like page 150 rn and im really enjoying it although its been a couple of weeks since i last read any of it. def gotta read more at some point! im realizing i really dont know how to talk about book im reading beyond like "wow its great!!" because im like illiterate or something. but like i fucking love the format of house of leaves and i love how its like slowly building up and woawww

#### the blind owl
this one was recommended to me by a friend!! i have basically only read the translator's notes so far so like i am not capable of having a very formed opinion on this book. but im excited to read it!

## listening
ok this is the hard one. its been 2 months!! ive listened to lots of stuff!!!!

as im writing this im listening to [monarch of monsters by vylet pony](https://vyletpony.bandcamp.com/album/monarch-of-monsters) for the first time!! really really good album how did i not find out about it sooner!!!!

been listening to a lot of [men i trust](https://menitrust.bandcamp.com/album/oncle-jazz) and [many rooms](https://manyrooms.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-body) also lately. many rooms is like PERFECT music for any time i am Chilling. great music while high also imo

oh wait also [femtanyl](https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/)!!! thats also in the last 2 months. had a couple of weeks where i just listened to femtanyl non-stopp. really really love [DOGMATICA](https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/track/dogmatica), [attacking vertical](https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/track/attacking-vertical-2), and [LOVESICK, CANNIBAL!](https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/track/lovesick-cannibal-feat-takihasdied). a lot of bangers in there!!! i also watched a movie solely because it was sampled in attacking vertical (u can read my review of that movie [here](https://comforttiger.space/watching/creep/))

oh oh oh and [acloudyskye](https://acloudyskye.bandcamp.com/music)! acloudyskye is an artist i actually discovered like ages ago because of beat saber and i'd been meaning to get into their music for agessss but never got around to it! my fav album by far is [What Do You Want!](https://acloudyskye.bandcamp.com/album/what-do-you-want)  
[Thief!](https://acloudyskye.bandcamp.com/track/thief) on that album is soo good

## other stuff??
idk theres other stuff too but idk how to categorize it! its hardd to recall what happened in the past and decide which things are worth mentioning

i have been making a lot of friends in my area lately! used to be sort of an unhappy isolated husk of a person but going out more and meeting more people has been soo great for me. i have my downs still but it helps with friends. its also a great change of pace to not always feel like im hopelessly dependent on like one singular person and if they ever stop talking to me my world will crumble

went to my first volunteer party at the cave a couple of days ago also! mayy have ended up drinking way too much at the preparty and getting sent home in a taxi after a couple of hours... but its ok! life is a series of lessons. this time the lesson was "dont drink an entire bottle of prosecco even though its yummy"  
that was my first time being drunk also. it was fun even though i was probably a bother to everyone around me lmao

start of this uni semester has been a little bit rocky, which is usual. but i think ive got control of things now! struggled hard with the first batch of assignments but now i think my groups are a little more established so we'll be able to get started on the next assignments easier. this semester i've got two courses, one about like distributed systems and networking and one about like c++, c#, and .net. i think it'll go ok!! next two semesters will be my bachelor and then i'll be done.. finally!!!
