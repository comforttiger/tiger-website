untitled plant game is a game where you take care of a very talkative plant.

i made it with [zoe](https://zoe.kittycat.homes) for [procjam 2021](https://www.procjam.com/)! the theme was "growth".  we had a lot of ideas for it, but most of them weren't ultimately fulfilled. someday i really wanna work more on the game and add lots more cute features. but either way im happy w the game! its nice watching the plant grow, and zoe did a great job on the music!

it's available on [itch.io](https://bathearttiger.itch.io/untitled-plant-game)
