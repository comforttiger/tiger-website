testament is a character from guilty gear! they're the character i main in guilty gear strive, and i just think they're really cool.

guilty gear strive was my first guilty gear game, having first heard about the series because of ~~brisket~~ ~~basket~~ ~~biscuit~~ bridget. i really wish i had found the series earlier, because everything about it has encapsulated me. i wish i couldve been autistic about previous entries in the series when they were new. but thats a topic for another post, because i'd love to write a broader post about my relationship with fighting games, and how guilty gear strive is the game that's made me finally able to play one after avoiding them like the plague for many years. and theres so much else to rant about in this game too, like oh my god the soundtrack, the characters, the everything... i'll go over all that in a future post.

## testament
okay, now. testament. testament was the second character i ever tried out when i got guilty gear strive, after bridget. bridget was an obvious first character to play as, since i became aware of the game because of her. after playing her for a little bit, and playing through her arcade story (which i have a lot to say about, but i don't know if i'll ever get to it), i looked at the roster to see if anyone else appealed. i thought may looked like a fun character, and giovanna is cool even though she's a cop, 

but okay come on what are we doing. there's a non-binary gear with a huge fucking scythe. 

<!-- insert picture of testament -->

like hello? of course i'm gonna play as the non-binary gear with the scythe. 

every move testament does looks fucking sick and they feel so fucking good to play as. as far as i understand, they're not considered the most competitively viable character to play as, because they're ultimately not the best zoner in the world? there was an update p recently as of writing this that i've only played a little bit, but the changes they made to testament certainly made them feel way better to play as. i dont know the competitive scene's opinion though, i try not to get too hung up on that stuff. because i'm not gonna let anyone stop me from playing as a cool non-binary gear with a huge scythe just because they're "not competitively viable" and "if you wanna be a zoner so bad just play axl". i will never play axl. (i do think axl's story is really fucking funny tho. british gangster from the 80s time travels to the future and all he wants to do is get back to his girlfriend.)

<!-- maybe insert a clip of me playing testament -->

testament's moveset is really tiny, but god does it feel like i can do a lot with it. its so satisfying to get into a flow of just fucking up the opponent with various mixes of the, like, three different moves testament has. and if they think they can stop me by getting close? no you can't, i have a SCYTHE. SCYTHES STAB PEOPLE. WATCH OUT!!!!

### okay but what about testament, the idea
*or; tiger poorly recollects random bits of what i've read about testament, thus telling you of my own idea about who testament is.*

my favourite thing about testament is that their character development from previous games is like, going from being a spiteful, angry, and hurt main villain in the games before. which like, is reasonable. they were turned into a gear, brainwashed, killed their own dad who they loved, humans aren't exactly the nicest to gears, etc. etc. etc.. but they go from that to being someone who's learned to live life and not let everything bad stop them from enjoying the good. i love that testament is like, incredibly powerful, but as far as i know, canonically, they just wanna go for a relaxing walk. they just want to experience nice things.

i thought their entire arcade story was really pleasant. obviously, the arcade stories were really limited in what they could do, but i think it has some quotes that really stuck with me and made me appreciate testament for more than just their huge scythe. the entire plot of the arcade is basically just, testament tries to go for a walk, and everyone is like "what the fuck are you doing this isnt safe for you", and then proceeds to attack testament to prove that its not safe for them. the "rival" in this one, the recurring character no matter what path you go down, is chipp, who just gets increasingly amazed at testament's endless resolve to just *go for a walk*. my favourite exchange is [this one](https://youtu.be/xpPq5TfgTQc?t=121):

> Chipp: That's so.. normal!! \
> Testament: I AM NORMAL! What, does a life need to have some grand purpose to be worth living?

idk lol, it's a very simple sentiment, but i really appreciate it. you're right, testament. i can just live life for the sake of living it. it's so easy to spend every moment of life worrying if you're doing something Meaningful with it, and i just forget that Living Life is meaningful enough already.
