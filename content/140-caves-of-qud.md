ive been playing [caves of qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/)!! non-stop!!! i bought it like a few days ago i think and now all im ever thinking about is caves of qud. ive not been able to sleep properly because either im thinking too much about caves of qud or im playing caves of qud. its 4am as i type this and i cant sleep cuz im too excited about this game!!! its such a fun game, ive not gotten that far into it yet cuz i keep dying and im enjoying the permadeath. ive started playing with fully randomized characters, which means i get to explore builds i wouldn't otherwise!

one of my recent deaths was caused by my character having "quantum jitters", which meant that sometimes when i used abilites, two spacetime vortexes would spawn near me, which will transport anything in its path to a random location. the inevitable happened, and i got caught in my own spacetime vortex. "this cant be too bad," i thought, before looking at the log and seeing it say i was *30 strata deep*. i didnt even know that was possible! ive only been, like, 3 strata deep! i boldly persevered nonetheless, and began my climb up, before i met this really strong guy who literally could kill me with one punch. i think i had been transported to a pretty high-level area... i evaded him for a bit, but eventually he killed me.

i think im gonna write a longer post about this game after i beat it. but i think that'll take a while!

ok now im gonna try to sleep. tomorrow im going to a black market in a cave and im excited for it!
