goodbye cohost, you will be missed

it's been a while since i wrote things on this blog. everyone on cohost is making blogs and setting up rss feeds and everything right now, so im doing the same again. 

i think blogs are nice. i hope to post more often on here! about all sorts of stuff! <br>
sometimes i find it hard to do. i have a lot of things i want to share but also a lot of anxiety <br>
hopefully i'll overcome that anxiety and start posting uninhibited about all the things i care about. if i do, you can expect me to post about learning japanese in the coming month. and then something else will consume all my excitement and i'll post about that. maybe there will be some communist ramblings, who knows! but first i must overcome my biggest weakness...
