so first of all i only watched this movie because it's sampled in attacking vertical by femtanyl.

ok i mean i did thoroughly enjoy it but like. it's just bad. it is just absolutely not good at doing anything it sets out to do. i like the first half only cuz it's like all so silly it was so fun to watch. but like for the most part any attempt at actually scaring me fell completely flat. i do love the characters tho, even if it isn't in the way the movie intended.

also you know the scene that's sampled in attacking vertical? i was soo disappointed. i was really hoping for more.

ok that was the review and then as i was about to post this i found out... they made a sequel??? i like literally assumed that this movie wouldve been like critically panned for how poorly it executes its premise but instead its like. they made a trilogy??? out of *this*? im sorry when i saw the word sequel on the wikipedia page for this movie i literally started laughing. maybe i should check it out
