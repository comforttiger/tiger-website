> **That was incredible, that was- You just had a near-death experience.**  
*Yeah*  
**That's what it feels like when you feel like you're gonna die.**  
**It's powerful, isn't it?**  
*Yeah, it is*  
**There was about two seconds there, after you were done being scared. Where it looked like you wanted to kill me.**  
**I don't take it personally. I think it was a visceral reaction, you know? There's an animal in you.**  
**Anybody you need to make peace with in this world? Before you go?**

so first of all i only watched this movie because it's sampled in [attacking vertical by femtanyl](https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/track/attacking-vertical-2). im sorry about the long quote but i wanted to include the bit that's sampled lol. its important context!!!

ok i mean i did thoroughly enjoy the movie but like. it's just bad. it is just absolutely not good at doing anything it sets out to do. i like the first half only cuz it's like all so silly it was so fun to watch. but like for the most part any attempt at actually scaring me fell completely flat. i do love the characters tho, even if it isn't in the way the movie intended.

also you know the scene that's sampled in attacking vertical? i was soo disappointed. i was really hoping for more.
