i liked it. i found myself laughing and cringing at parts of the movie because casey felt so real. i see so much of what i was like at that age in casey and i think the movie did a really good job at speaking to like, isolation when you're young. the need to seek refuge in scary and edgy stuff is so relatable as someone who went through exactly that as a teenager. and i love how open-ended and vague things are left. as someone whos entire sense of reality would often slip when i was an isolated teenager watching everything from creepypastas to real life people dying, i think leaving things so vague resonated to that experience. by the end of the movie i think lots of people probably have very different interpretations of what happened, whats real and whats not, etc.. and my personal interpretation is entirely coated in the specific ways that i related to the main character.
