i wanna start writing reviews here of stuff ive seen recently, especially when its stuff i like. so heres what i thought about akudama drive!

i found out about akudama drive because i am a huge fan of the danganronpa series of games and hearing that the danganronpa guys made a movie was like whoa wait what i have to see this.

you can tell this anime is by the danganronpa guys because they have an obsession with making stories about "normal" main characters who are surrounded by incredible people. danganronpa its a guy in a highschool with no talent surrounded by people with super talents. in akudama drive its a petty criminal in a cyberpunk world being bunched in with people who are essentially on the FBI's top most wanted list. i think its a compelling starting point for a story, and its a big part of why i like both danganronpa and akudama drive!

without saying too much, i think akudama drive explores the idea of like, what makes a criminal? really well. towards the end especially it really focuses on this, the idea that the distinction between a regular person and a criminal is ultimately just an arbitrary line drawn by the ones in power. committing a crime isnt about committing something morally bad, but about threatening those in power.

the soundtrack in akudama drive is also like. damn. it got me really extra hyped during some moments i loved it. and i think that the animation and art are really really nice to look at.

so thats my thoughts on akudama drive! its a nice little anime. i like it. you wont get any ratings beyond "i like it" or "i hate it". (oh it'd be fun to have a "hates" tag for anything i watch that i don't like)
