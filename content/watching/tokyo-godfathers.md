endless coincidences one after another compounding into ridiculous scenarios is like my favourite brand of comedy and this does that really well, but doesn't stop itself there. i was worried early on about its portrayal of Hana, but by the end this movie's love and compassion for all the people it portrays shines through. while also being a goofy movie it simultaneously manages to be such a loving, compassionate view of people in society often looked down upon, while also not being scared to portray the messiness inherent. i love movies about families.
