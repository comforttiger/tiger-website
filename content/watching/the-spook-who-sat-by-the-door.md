ok ok i liked this one. maybe even loved it actually. it just like gets better and better the further it takes the premise. the way it mixes humour with like really sharp criticisms and reflections around systemic racism and resistance makes it so i like switched between like. one scene im laughing and then suddenly the next scene im crying because like oh my god.
