> ***Mr. Yamada's son-in-law told me that I should not use violence. But violence is justified if the end result is good. As long as I live, I'll continue to use violence by my own judgment if it brings good results to me and for the sake of mankind.***

an incredible documentary. what better way can you showcase the complacency, loyalty, and prevailing attitude of "letting the past stay in the past", than by showing it in contrast with its complete opposite, embodied by a man who recognized that we must acknowledge the horrors of war to learn from our past.

the documentary follows okuzaki, a violent and slightly crazy man, on his attempt to learn the truth about crimes committed by fellow veterans. the way he swaps between incredible politeness and unrestrained violence to get people to admit to their crimes is wild. there's something about his intense directness against the prevailing expectation of indirectness and politeness. the morality of okuzaki is questionable but his goals are unquestionably good. i don't know man this movie was just good it makes me wanna ramble. it really strikes on the inherent dissonance of moving past the war without really addressing any of the underlying causes. why are soldiers not held accountable for executing other soldiers after the end of the war? why is the emperor not held accountable? okuzaki sees these problems and he addresses it in a morally gray way, but at least he tries to do something.
