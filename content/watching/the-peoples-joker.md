i loved this movie! i dont know how well i can articulate my feelings for it beyond that!!!

you can tell the movie was made on a budget and you can tell its a passion project from someone who really knew what they wanted to do. ive not seen a movie thats so relatable to my experience being trans like ever. this movie is so direct about all of it, instead of speaking through layers and layers of metaphors. its not that i have anything against metaphors, but i just loved seeing a character in a movie that just says "im trans, and here is my explicitly trans story"

im just happy this movie exists in the world. who knew a queer coming-of-age batman parody movie could be so fucking good
