its fine. its fineee. its ok.

i dont feel like i have a lot to say about it ok! watching it feels more like watching slop even if i still think there are some good messages in this season. and like i appreciated the attempt with the trans character. its clear theyre trying their best and i think the message is nice. but its also just kinda like. half of this season was just call of duty. the season's ending feels so abrupt. the creator should get a break. etc. etc. etc.. thats all. the season mostly feels like it just exists to build up to a season 3. it doesnt feel like its meant to stand on its own. so like. ok

i really need to watch like a good movie again soon
