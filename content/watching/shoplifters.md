emotionally crushing movie. i loved it. so sweet and so heartbreaking. the way that normal society frowns upon those who dare be imperfect but find each other despite it all, is presented so well in this movie, and the scenes with yuri and nobuyo really really hit me. so heartfelt, so sweet, i cried so much.
