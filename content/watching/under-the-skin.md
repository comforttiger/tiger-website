ok shes kinda girlbossing tho

im still kinda rotating this in my brain. theres some neat stuff in this movie! i think maybe i'd benefit from rewatching it someday, i think i watched it with the wrong expectations? but like, reflecting more on the movie after finishing it im realizing i really appreciated the way it completely subverts the premise in a way i didnt expect at all. there are several really good scenes in the movie that i'll probably remember for a while because of how good they were at conveying such emotions, and i absolutely loved how Silent the movie was at so many points. there was so much happening visually, but often with nothing but silent droning in the background. it puts you in the shoes of the main character in a way that really pays off in the last half.

ok yeah now that ive started rambling a bit i actually think this movie was really good??? i rated it like 3 stars earlier on letterboxd but like what was i thinking man. this is at least a 4 star. or something. idk stars dont mean much. but like, i for sure liked this movie. the more i think about it its like. ok you could have made a sort of mid sci-fi horror movie about a girlboss alien killing lonely men. but instead its about this alien slowly becoming more vulnerable in its isolation on this lone planet, growing empathy for the people on it, trusting others, and then having that trust completely shattered. trying to be more like the people she's growing empathetic towards but constantly being reminded of how she's fundamentally incapable of being like them. i cant stop rotating that ending in my head and its like ok maybe i love this movie a little bit. just a little bit.
