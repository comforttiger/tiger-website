this movie was alright! i enjoyed noriko's dinner table more, but this was good horror. its presentation of peer pressure was super chilling and felt real. i love when movies have people, especially younger people, be so nonchalant about murder and suicide. it feels very recognizable to my experience from like high school and middle school. stuff in the news can feel so intense that it seems almost ridiculous and you just can't help but try to find humour in it. it's interesting watching this movie today, when it feels like every year there is some new scary online thing trying to get kids to kill themselves, or theres always some dangerous trend going around. cool movie, very unsettling
