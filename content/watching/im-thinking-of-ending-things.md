i watched this movie in 2020 around when it came out, and i decided to rewatch it today because i thought i might appreciate it more now and i couldn't really remember anything from it. now i realize why i dont remember much of it though, it just wasnt really my thing. i think theres some neat stuff in here about relationships, aging, memory, etc.. but it didnt hit me that hard tbh.
