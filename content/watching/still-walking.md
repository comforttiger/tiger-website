> ***It's always like that. I'm always a little late.***

what a beautiful movie. i love kore-eda's work so much. the way he lets the audience sit in those grounded, mundane moments that speak volumes when you give them the chance. still walking is such a simple, but powerful story about family and grief. the way it slowly reveals more and more about the relationship in a way that feels so natural was so captivating. the end of the movie absolutely crushed me, i couldn't help but cry. it makes you think about how important it is to set aside time for your loved ones while you still can. most, i think, can relate to "always being a little late" with everything. it's so much easier to put things off than it is to do them while you can.
