i wasnt planning on doing it at first, but now i have comments!

up until now i've had my cute little email me button, but i discovered a way to do comments in a way thats fun for me. so, i did it! comments support markdown and html, so go wild. in theory u could do css crimes, in my comments!! just dont do anything malicious cuz then im just not gonna approve ur comment... 

also theres replies!!! for a moment there i wasnt sure if i was gonna be able to add replies, but then i realized that its not so hard actually!

all of it was simultaneously p difficult and incredibly easy. the way my comments work now is that when you comment something, it sends a post request to my server, which then sends a pull request containing your comment to my github repository. and then i can approve or delete the pull request!

i also still think people should totally email me if they want to! my email is still available on the front page of my website, and i think its nice to still have a way to speak more privately if ppl prefer it.  
but comments are nice because they feel a lot more... social, i guess? cuz people other than me can be part of a conversation, if they want to. i think its nice to have that option!
