*(im gonna use "movies" as a catch-all tag for stuff im watching)*

ive been watching atypical recently! or, rewatching it, but more on that later. i just recently finished season 1. its a show about an autistic kid, sam. it opens up with him deciding he wants to start dating, and then conflicts ensue as he has to learn all these new social rules, his overprotective mom feels she's losing purpose, his dad learns to connect with him more, and his sibling mostly just does their own thing.

## my history with atypical: 2017 was a wild time

atypical released around 2017 (note to self: check this). 2017 was a wild time for me.

### being autistic and trying to get hormones
this was when i was trying to get hormones, so even though several psychologists had told me i was definitely autistic, i had to beg each of them not to diagnose me, because that would reduce my chances of getting hormones. this was a time when i was really trying to hide that i was autistic because i really needed hormones. it would take like 3 more years after this until i finally got hormones, and the people i spoke to that day were like "hey, isnt it weird that you dont have an autism diagnosis? because you are definitely autistic" and i was like "heheh, idk...." and then luckily they gave me hormones anyways.

so you can see how, like, literally any media depicting autism might've been nice for me at the time. i cant relate to everything about sam, but there are a lot of things i can relate to about him, things that i was usually trying really hard to mask. so in that sense, it was nice to just have a character to relate to. and i wasnt gonna be very nitpicky about what counted as good representation then, because i didnt know about any other representation. i still dont really know of much good autistic representation in media.

### my dad cheating on my mom
the other big thing that happened when i was 17 was that my mom found out my dad had been cheating on her for 7 years, and they separated. the separation wasnt a big deal to me, i had been hoping they'd separate someday since i was 8, and i was just glad i could pick who i would stay with. the thing that really affected me at the time was the fact that this was a new thing to add to list of reasons to resent my dad, and the fact that he just acted like nothing happened. in the week before we moved out he would just talk to me as if nothing was happening at all, or he'd treat the moving out as just like, A Thing. just a normal thing thats happening for no reason in particular. *that* drove me mad. i just couldn't understand why he couldn't even have the decency to acknowledge the situation. i still can't understand it. i still don't forgive him for anything he's done.

uhh how does that connect to atypical? well, you see, sam's mom cheats in the show. casey is not happy about it. i mentioned earlier how i related to lots of things in sam, but what i didnt actually expect was how much i would relate to casey. casey's reaction to their mom cheating on their dad became an initial connecting point and then it was just like, okay now this is a show about casey to me. sam is a side character and i really just care about casey and i want to see how they get through this because i certainly had no idea.

## what do i think of the show now?
### its bad
i would not call it a "good show". it suffers from pretty much everything you'd imagine a show about autism written by neurotypicals would. i hate how often sam's autism is just the punchline of a joke, and how rarely they're willing to explore it beyond that. theres so many little things theyll mention just because like ohhh isnt this a quirky autism trait but then it just never comes up again! but honestly, the stuff that's bad about atypical isnt interesting. im not watching it for that, and im not interested in writing it for that. so this is more like a disclaimer to say you should not watch this show!!!

i have heard somewhere that it supposedly gets better in the later seasons, because they addressed the criticisms about it being entirely by neurotypicals by hiring more autistic writers. which is good! i dont know if the show actually becomes better in the later seasons, but im excited to find out, and i might write another post about it if it does.

### what i like
<!-- i wanna write wayyyy more in here!!! -->
i think what makes the show worthwhile for me to watch is like, every character in his family that isnt him. every character in sam's family that isnt sam. every character except sam is genuinely very interesting to me. i think the show did a surprisingly good job of capturing the "autism mom" archetype, i absolutely adore sam's sibling, casey, and when i started watching the show i began running because i wanted to be more like them. that running thing didnt amount to much, but a part of me still wants to be a runner and its entirely casey's fault. running sounds fun if you can get past the excrutiating pain! sam's dad has really fun development throughout the show, and i actually did really enjoy seeing him connect with his son, and actively try to be a better person.
