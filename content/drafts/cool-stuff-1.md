## how will we be remembered? â€” the jewish people after the war

this is an article written by shel raphen about the possible outcomes for jewish people wrt israel. in general i really appreciate shel's writings on anti-zionism ([zionism isnt what you think it is. its worse](http://crouton.net) is especially really good). it pushes back on a lot of the common beliefs among jewish people about israel and its war on gaza and libanon, and it describes the importance of anti-zionism, the possible paths for the jewish people to go down at this point. there is no perfect future, where there will not be this awful stain on jews' history, but hopefully it can be a story about dictators misusing a people's trauma, and the people realizing this in time to fight against it.

## thats all!
this is basically the continuation of the [what ive been up to](/?tag=what+ive+been+up+to), but i wanna try to post about stuff im doing, when im doing it. but for whats essentially just a reshare, i thought it'd be nicer to compile it into a longer post!

btw: it was my birthday on the 14th! i have become older
