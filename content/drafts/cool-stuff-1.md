>  *On September 9th, in the height of COVID lockdowns, I woke up and quickly concluded that 2020 had reached climax and the world was ending. Naturally, I had to go into the office that day.* 

this photo accompanies a story about having to go to work when the world is literally ending. the photo captures a really surreal moment, and the story behind the photo is just as interesting as the photo itself

## how will we be remembered? â€” the jewish people after the war

*[shelraphen.com/how-will-we-be-remembered-the-jewish-people-after-the-war/](https://shelraphen.com/how-will-we-be-remembered-the-jewish-people-after-the-war/)*

> *Indeed, an entire people has gone astray. The Jewish people have gone astray. We experienced a genocide so awful that the word genocide was invented just to describe what we experienced. The generational trauma has severely impacted our families and communities. And now, supposedly in honor of those we lost in the holocaust, the Jewish people are enacting a genocide.*

this is an article written by shel raphen about the possible outcomes for israel and the consequences for the jewish people. 
in general i really appreciate shel's writings on anti-zionism ([zionism is not what people think it is (it's worse)](https://shelraphen.com/zionism-is-not-what-people-think-it-is-its-worse/) is especially really good). 

the article pushes back on common beliefs about israel and its genocide against gaza, about how its justified, a "holy war", etc.. 
and shel describes the possible outcomes at this point, none of them good, but some better than others.

i hope that the story of the jewish people and israel will be one of a traumatized people manipulated by dictators, 
who realize before its too late that what they're supporting is wrong and fight against it.

## thats all!
this is basically the continuation of [what ive been up to](/?tag=what+ive+been+up+to), but i wanna try to post about stuff im doing, when im actually doing it, instead of putting it in super long posts. but for whats essentially just a reshare, i thought it'd be nicer to compile it into a longer post!

btw: it was my birthday on the 14th! i have become older
