some pictures ive taken the past month-ish! i havent set aside any time for a real photography walk where i bring my nice camera and stuff, but sometimes ive seen something and gone "ohh that looks cool" and then taken a quick picture w my phone. theres been a lot of fog lately!!! makes everything look automatically cooler imo
