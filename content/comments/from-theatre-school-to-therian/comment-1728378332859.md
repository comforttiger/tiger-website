thank u for reading my blogpost and commenting! i really appreciate it :3  

adjectives are definitely not used as often as more noun-y words, but i can remember seeing others use *suwi* and *nasa* as their identifiers before!

some other common ones are *ilo*, *kulupu*, and *ko*. *kulupu* is used a lot by plural systems. i also think i remember someone using "wan" to describe individual members of a plural system!
