this was rly cute to read :3 i think it'd be nice if more people knew more about themselves. i don't think that many people settle on "human" as the ultimate expression of the self, if they really stop to think about it, tbh. 

if i can ask a toki pona question, what other sorts of identifiers do people use? like adjectives maybe? does anyone use "suwi" the same way you use "soweli," for instance?
