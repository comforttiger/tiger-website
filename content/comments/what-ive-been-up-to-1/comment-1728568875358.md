i actually dont know if i'll do another one of these! im thinking i'd rather just make individual posts about things im watching or listening to or what im doing when i feel like it. so in the future i'd write a blog post about star trek: discovery instead of it being as part of this larger post about everything.

a part of me worries about posting *too often* or things like that, but it is my blog and ppl can just put me in the "omg shut upppp" category of their rss reader if they get tired of seeing my posts too often.

my blogging is in a very experimental phase!!! im still figuring out what the hell im doing and how the best way to post is!

im writing this as a comment on my own post cuz i wanna write it down somewhere...
