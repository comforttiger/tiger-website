trainyard trouble is a game where you stack cargo on trains. the goal is to make sure your cargo hold doesnt overflow, with only three trains at your disposal.

its a game i made for a [godot wild jam](https://godotwildjam.com/) with [zoe](https://zoe.kittycat.homes)! the theme was "combine".

i really wanna remake this one sometime. we were using godot 4 before it was really stable at all, so we couldn't do web exports, and there's lots of small little bugs and glitches i'd love to fix. they keep me up at night.

also, when we first released the game we got a lot of confused comments from people who didn't quite understand the game; "why am i suddenly losing on day 3? what happened? i don't understand!!", so i updated it after the jam was over to ease the difficulty curve more, hoping it'd make the game easier to understand. in retrospect though, i think i eased the difficulty curve TOO much. whenever i play the game nowadays i find it impossible to lose, whereas before it was a nice 5 minute game where getting a high score was really satisfying. so i *really* wanna remake this one and figure out a middle-ground between the two

on another note: im really proud of the art i did for this one! i think there's some containers i'd want to redo if i had the chance, but i'm proud of most of them

it's available on [itch.io](https://bathearttiger.itch.io/trainyard-trouble)!
