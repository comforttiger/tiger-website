<!-- ask from luis: if one day everyone on earth could only eat 1 food item for the rest of their lives what would yours be? -->

hii! thank u for the ask :3

its a hard question! theres many angles to look at it from.

my first instinct was "oh, my favourite food is carbonara, so its gotta be carbonara". but if you think about that for a little longer, imagine how annoying that'd be!! i would have to create a proper warm meal every time i was hungry and i would probably get bored of it sooner or later! so i think the favourite food approach is intuitive, but too naive.....

what i think the strat is, is to pick like a really normal food. i usually eat bread with some simple topping like nutella or cheese, or crispbread with caviar. but thats yet another trap, you see! because you gotta make sure its not *too* boring, because then eating will feel like a chore. 

you could solve this problem by making it *even more* boring, like if you went for like a smoothie approach. just like, a balanced smoothie that you can just chug in like a minute and then you're good to go. sure, its boring, but its also effortless. i'd probably want a mango flavoured smoothie, thats the best smoothie flavour i think...

*or* you could do like a tasty sandwich. one thats not *too* much effort to make, but thats still fun to eat, and nutritious. or maybe a salad? but i dont think salads have ever appealed much to me, so it'd have to be a sandwich. maybe a chicken sandwich of some sort? or if not that, then at least one that has some ham and cheese, along with other nice things.

uhhh i dont know what my answer is though. maybe carbonara.
