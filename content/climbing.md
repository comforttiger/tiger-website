i finally hiked up a mountain again! and it made me remember holy shit this is like the best thing in the world theres literally nothing better than walking upwards why have i not been doing this every week??? i am posting this like 2 weeks after this hike and ive gone on one more hike since then, but didnt really take any photos on that one. i actually almost didnt even think to bring my camera to this hike but luckily a friend was like "oh you should bring your camera!" because like ive been talking so much about how i need to take photos more often and somehow i didnt put two and two together and think of bringing the camera on my own??

the hike was soo exhausting! this mountain has like the worst stairs i have ever used in my life. they spent like over a million dollars on it can u believe it. got straight up scammed. anyways. good hike!! i am definitely gonna go on another soon and bring my camera again!!! just have to find a time where i am NOT extremely stressed with exams... *(i have an exam in... like 32 hours.)* but at the same time my toxic trait is that any time im stressed about an exam i start thinking about this website again and THATS when i start posting and making improvements to it again. ive been thinking about ways to make posting more easier so i'll stop using tumblr for all my silly small posts but i have some things i havent figured out yet there (i could really easy make like a post editor for myself that could let me easily make a post from my phone, but uploading images without having access to my computer would be harder...) BUT now is NOT the time for that!!! i have to lock in and do the exams stuff!!!!!!
