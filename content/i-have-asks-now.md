i have asks now!!  
i realized i can use the same system that i use for comments, to also have asks! yay!!!!

the form for sending me asks is on the front page, right below all my links! i dont expect it to get used that much, but i thought its a fun little thing to have :3

they pretty much work exactly the same as comments, except i can easily answer them in a post like this! so its great for, like... asking me stuff!
