im watching kamen rider kuuga right now and --

actually no i was watching kamen rider kuuga like an hour ago and then i thought "wow this show is cool!!! i wanna write a short post about it to my blog" and then i had an existential crisis about whether or not im allowed to write short blog posts, and then i spent some time to perfect how i present shortform posts (now i can have posts without titles, and short posts will be shown in their entirety on the feed on the frontpage) and NOW i can finally post about kamen rider kuuga.

so anyways im 4 episodes in and kamen rider kuuga is really fun. it has like SUCH bad special effects its so charming ([heres a clip](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx37wljqH-LrNb-n48WSC-xgu969L9h9AU?si=9zW-qoHQI8xi4Wfo)) and the characters are fun guys. the main character is such a guy i love him.

i started watching the show because of [this post](https://entanma.com/posts/2024-09-17-Rambling%20about%20Kamen%20Rider%20pt%201.html) by azure from [nuclear strawberry](https://entanma.com/)! this show ROCKS.
