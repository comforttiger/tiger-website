trainyard trouble is a game where you stack cargo on trains. the goal is to make sure your cargo hold doesnt overflow, with only three trains at your disposal.

its a game i made for a [godot wild jam](https://godotwildjam.com/) with [zoe](https://zoe.kittycat.homes)!

im especially proud of the art i did for this one :)
