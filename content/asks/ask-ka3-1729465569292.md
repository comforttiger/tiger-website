hi hi! this is so random but i've been wanting to get into website creation/design and am really unfamiliar with the technical side of things. i found y'all's site through the toki pona lessons page and overall liked the site design, so i wanted to ask what you two used to build the website and if there are any resources you might recommend for someone hoping to learn? thank you :p
