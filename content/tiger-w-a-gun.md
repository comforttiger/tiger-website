the first pixel art i ever drew! i made it while teaching myself godot by making a game i called "goblbin slayer" (named after a game i made in scratch when i was 13). the game was just for my own learning purposes, so no one else will ever see it...

this is also the closest i've ever come to drawing a fursona. someday i'll draw a *real* fursona.
