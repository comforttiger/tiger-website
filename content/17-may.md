three days ago was the 17th of may! we celebrate that in norway because thats when a bunch of guys wrote a thing

i usually havent done much on the 17th of may because ive usually been isolated and not had many people near me to spend it with so its felt a little pointless to do anything. but now i have lots of friends who live close to me!! so i had plans for the whole day basically, from 8am to 2am! 

8am was a breakfast at the rock venue i volunteer at. buuut i overslept so i missed it... i was soo heartbroken when i woke up at like 10am and realized i had missed it!!!! but luckily there were other plans, so it wasnt too bad! 

at noon until like 8pm i had lunch and partied with a bunch of friends. everyone brought food so there was lots of delicious food and dessert to eat! i had this big black umbrella because i thought it would fit my cool black dress really well but it turned out to be smart because the sun was so strong it was nice to have some shade. other people kept coming under my umbrella too or borrowing it just to get some shade. i got lots of compliments on my look which makes me really wish i could go all-out on makeup every day without running out way too quickly!!!

at 9pm was a party at that rock venue i volunteer at! the 17th of may is also the birthday of the rock venue so its like a big event where they have like different prizes they hand out and stuff. and then we had a parade at midnight where we were the worst neighbours and just made as much noise as humanly possible while walking through the streets. it was fun. 

AND THEN i got home at like 2am and the fire alarm in the student housing where i live had gone off which was great because that meant all my friends who live in that block were already outside and i got to talk to them for like an hour or two while i was still really drunk.
