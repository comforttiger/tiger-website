i dyed my hair again!! i really wanted to dye it again since the previous purple had turned into a green-blueish colour instead... i used schwarzkopf mystic violet! it looks mostly black i think, but in some lighting u can tell its purple. which is what i wanted!! i only bought one box when i should've bought two, so im happy it worked out anyways! theres no like, obvious big spots i missed. just some small places that arent usually visible!!!

its soo fucking cool im so happy with it.
