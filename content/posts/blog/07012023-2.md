the test was a success! now i can put the selfies i took today here :3

(TODO: add images)

i took them with this fancy new camera
i got recently. at first i was just looking into simple point-and-shoots because my flip phone's camera wasnt good enough to take selfies with

but then i kinda went down a big rabbit hole about camera equipment and stuff. and i always wanted to get more into photography!

soo i found this really good used mirrorless camera + lens for around €200-300¹. and im happy with it! im excited to take some more pictures with it!!

probably gonna add like. a photography section to /made and put photos i take there.

¹it cost that but then i had to pay like another €150 becuase of tolls. eugh. still happy with the camera tho :)
