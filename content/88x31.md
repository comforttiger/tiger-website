i made one! i struggled a bit with figuring out what i wanted to do with it, but im happy with it now! i tried to make it look sorta like my website :3

it originally looked like this:

<a href="https://tiger.kittycat.homes/" target="_blank"
    ><img
      src="/tiger-button.png"
      alt="a button with a little creature in the bottom corner, with a starry sky above them. it says 'tiger' in a small pixel font"
      class="hover:scale-[2] hover:relative w-[88px] h-[31px]"
      style="
        image-rendering: pixelated;
        transition: filter 0.1s linear;
        transition: transform 0.05s linear;
        width: 88px;
        height: 31px;
      "
  /></a>

but i wasnt really happy with it!

so then i made this:

<a href="https://tiger.kittycat.homes/" target="_blank"
    ><img
      src="/tiger-button.gif"
      alt="the same button, but now the creature bounces up and down a bit, the stars wiggle, and the font is more detailed"
      class="hover:scale-[2] hover:relative"
      style="
        image-rendering: pixelated;
        transition: filter 0.1s linear;
        transition: transform 0.05s linear;
        width: 88px;
        height: 31px;
      "
  /></a>

i decided to mess around with making it animated, and then i also put way more effort into the text! i was surprised how easy all the letters were, except e. e is the bane of my existence. its so hard to make a good looking e. i tried to make all the letters look sort of like a pixel version of the display font i use on this website!

let me know if you link to my website so i can link back (or just cuz it'll make me happy!)

im also replacing that cool sites list i used to have with a wall of 88x31 buttons. replicating people's website styling to make buttons on my website was cool and all, but it did take me a lot of time to do! and i think its better if there isnt so much friction between "oh, i should link to this website." and actually linking to it.

im still figuring out what i'll do about the ones who dont have a button! i thought maybe i could make a little makeshift button to put on my website in those cases, but maybe that's weird? is it? let me know!!!!
