i made one! here it is:

<img
      src="/tiger-button.png"
      class="hover:scale-[2]"
      style="
        image-rendering: pixelated;
        width: 88px !important;
        height: 31px;
        transition: filter 0.1s linear;
        transition: transform 0.05s linear;
      "
  />

let me know if you link to my website so i can link back (or just cuz it'll make me happy!)

im also replacing that cool sites list i used to have with a wall of 88x31 buttons. replicating people's website styling to make buttons on my website was cool and all, but it did take me a lot of time to do! and i think its better if there isnt so much friction between "oh, i should link to this website." and actually linking to it.

im still figuring out what i'll do about the ones who dont have a button! i thought maybe i could make a little makeshift button to put on my website in those cases, but maybe that's weird? is it? let me know!!!!
