<!-- write about hoptix recently releasing in early access because of cohost shutdown -->

<!-- write about playing the game and loving it -->

<!-- relate the love for the game with other games i've loved because of the speed; dustforce, but also trackmania -->

<!-- the really cool thing about hoptix is that it doesn't require you to go fast. it doesn't punish you for figuring out where the targets are at your own pace, for taking your time to explore the incredibly beautiful levels. -->

<!-- the potential skill expression is there, but it's fully the player's choice to explore it. when you play a game like trackmania, you *have* to learn to go fast. the game will constantly tell u that ur not doing good enough otherwise! hoptix, on the other hand, tells you that you win just by playing. games are just about playing -->
