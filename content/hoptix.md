i wanna start writing posts about games i like, and other things i like also! here's the first one. its about hoptix!!

hoptix is a game i found out about through posts on cohost. seeing the ocassional gifs of the game made me excited about it, it looked cool, rocket is a cute bnuyy, and i love games where you can go FAST!! i used to really enjoy dustforce, and trackmania (especially full speed maps), because theres just something awesome about doing tricks and going fast.

recently it released in early access, because of cohost shutting down. hoptix's community is essentially a cohost community, so they wanted to make sure that the people who were the most excited for the game could celebrate and enjoy the game together as a community before cohost's shutdown. im really happy about that decision! i think that seeing other people enjoying the game too always adds to the experience of playing a new game, and im glad i got to experience the game with other ppl on cohost. 

hoptix is pretty short! i beat all the levels that are currently available in like, 1 hour? but dont let that fool you. theres so many ways to traverse through each level, and experimenting with movement is fun! its not a game you play for 30 hours in a weekend and then never pick up again, its a game you pick up ocassionally for some fun zoomies every once in a while, for as long as you want.

the game never punishes you for bonking into a ceiling, or not knowing where that last target is, or anything like that. its entirely about exploring really beautiful levels, while listening to a really good soundtrack, and just doing the moves that feel right. theres so much skill expression thats possible, but the game never pressures you into playing any particular way. you get to decide whats cool! its really nice compared to other games ive played, where itll constantly tell you that you need to get better, the win condition always gets moved further up, until you're like, the best player in the world or whatever. but in hoptix you win just by playing. you got from point a to point b however you wanted, and thats a win!

rocket is just cool, you cant do anything about it. no matter what you make them do, it will feel cool. and when you discover something really cool, you can hit a button to record a gif of it and share it with your friends! and thats what games should be about, i think. just sharing the stuff you found cool with your friends.
