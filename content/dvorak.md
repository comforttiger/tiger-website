ive found a new way to be quirky about my computer usage! 

im switching to programmer dvorak!!

im typing really slowly and it feels like learning a new language, but its honestly really fun to use

on qwerty touch typing always felt super awkward and unintuitive, but on dvorak all the motions are just like nice and fun!
im gonna write a longer entry about how much i like dvorak later when i can type faster, right now it would take too long eotueonuho (dvorak keysmash)

im definitely obsessed tho its just so fun to type with!!!
