as i mentioned in my post yesterday, i went to a black market at a cave today!! it was a market for ppl who wear goth/dark clothing, not a market where they sell illegal goods... the best part honestly was just that going to a goth event made me feel safer to experiment with my makeup, so i did a look thats a little bolder than what i usually dare to do, and now i'll probably be going with this look more often. i finally got to try out my black lipstick i bought recently, and i love how my eyemakeup looks.. i think it looks cool!!!! i look cool!!

i only bought 2 stickers, and got one for free. it was so overwhelming and there was so much stuff, i ended up not buying anything else! but im thinking that i might buy some black hairdye with the unspent money i had set aside for this.... especially since my current dye is sort of disappearing, and i want my hair to look as cool as possible for the next goth event

oh, also theres a bigger goth event happening at the cave in like 3 weeks, so the black market felt sort of like a nice way to prepare for that, since ive never been at the cave before. i saw soo many cool people also, im gonna try to have the courage to talk to some of the cool ppl when the next goth event happens!

## ok but what do you mean by "the cave"???
oh, sorry! "the cave" is a rock venue in the area i live. its in a literal cave that used to be a bomb shelter!!
