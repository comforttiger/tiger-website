i was at a halloween event at the cave today!!! god i love the cave so much. i danced for like 4 hours and im so tired now. i was so happy when spellbound by siouxsie and the banshees started playing

people kept asking me what i was dressed as and when i told them im just dressed as myself they'd be like "whoaaa you look so awesome!!!"
