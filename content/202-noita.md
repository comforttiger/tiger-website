ive been getting into noita again lately and just had the best run yet!!

i got to The Vault for the first time which is way further than usual! usually i die two levels earlier at hiisi base. it was my first time not dying instantly at the jungle!

i had an awesome wand setup. i had a double shotgun thing going on, where i had two spells that shoot like a shotgun blast, and a thing that made it so that i'd fire both of those spells at once. and then when it got really crazy was when i added another spell that made it so that enemies i hit get like absolutely fucked by an endless barrage of lightning explosions. i literally killed everything in one hit, the only drawback was that i could only do the lightning explosion thing 20 times per level. when i got to The Vault i decided to remove the lightning explosion from my shotgun and put it on a different wand and i think this is the decision that killed me. if i had stuck with my awesome lightning explosion double shotgun i think i would've remained unstoppable.

noita is fun!
